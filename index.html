    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <div id="intro">
        <p>Good day. My name is <b>Ryan Els</b> and I am a programmer from South Africa.</p> 
        <p>I am looking for a graphic designer who would like to collaborate with me on this project.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project is first and foremost a chance for us to show off our skills and to create a product we can both be proud of.</p>
        <p>The mission is to eventually publish the app to all available app stores and to monetize the app.
        Until that point this project will be a labour of love.</p>
        <p>Once the app is published you will be co-owner of the app and share in any profits up to 49%.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>If you are interested please read on...</b></p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>The App</h3>
    <div id="app">
        <p>The app is a memory training app based on the Major Memory System.</p>
        <p>The app will make use of a gaming concept to keep the users attention and make the learning experience fun and interactive.</p>
        <p>There are many memory training apps on the market. And some of them are doing very well with over 10 million downloads.</p>
        <p>So there is definitely a market for this type of app.</p>
        <p>What will set this app apart from the competition is the fun and entertaining approach we will bring to the app.</p>
        <p>As yet the app does not have an official name. But the working title is the Major Memory App. 
        We can brainstorm to come up with something a little more catchy.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Want to join the project?</h3>
    <div id="join">
        <p>I believe in raw talent and I believe there are some excellent graphic designers out there that have never had a chance to prove themselves yet. 
        So I want to give everybody a chance to apply regardless of who they are or where they are from.
        What I am looking for is real talent. Somebody with a flare for design and a sense of pride in their work. 
        Because I want the app to be of high quality and for it to stand out and have that WOW factor.</p>
        <p>So if you are interested in collaborating with me I require one thing from you. You must pass the test below.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>The Test</h3>
    <div id="test">
        <p>I want you to design the Major for the app. Nothing too fancy. You can even do a couple of pencil sketches for now. 
        I just need to see the quality of your design work. The Major is the central character for the app. He is a Major in the army.</p>
        <p>Good luck with your application.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions please feel free to contact me on messenger or you can drop me an email at ryanelsguitar@gmail.com</p>
    </div>
    <h3>For Inspiration</h3>
    <p id="inspiration">Here are images of the Major I am using in an early version of the app. He looks too serious and angry.</p>
